Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?\n\nA) Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\nB) Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed.
