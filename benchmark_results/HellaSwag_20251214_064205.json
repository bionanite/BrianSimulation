Instead, use a permanent press or heavy duty setting.\nB) [substeps] Be aware that jeans can shrink as a result of wearing them. Use caution when washing jeans that are hot running this cycle.\nC) Ensure you are using a light cycle, not a heavy one. Fill the washing machine's water tank with only one cup (250 ml) of water, typically for heavy jeans.\nD) [substeps] Since jeans are water-resistant, this process is not recommended. Hot water will only shrink jeans, and jeans can shrink between 120 and 120 \u00b0 f (93 to 93 \u00b0 c).\n",
