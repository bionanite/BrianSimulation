In a hypothetical environment, the coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive, with the result that both the coat pattern and the cross-eyed condition increase in a feline population over time. Which statement is supported by these observations?\n\nA) Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population.\nB) Phenotype is often the result of compromise.\nC) Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time.\nD) Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive, and should become less common in future generations.\n",
