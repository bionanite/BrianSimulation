[step] Before the advent of \" no fault \" divorce, proving adultery was one of the few grounds on which a divorce could be granted. Today, however, couples can simply claim irreconcilable differences and be divorced.\n\nWhat happens next? Choose the most likely ending:\n\nA) Different reasons for wanting to be married depend on where your marriage took place. [substeps] Domestic violence: if you and your partner had a relationship that lasted over two years, you can prove adultery by fighting how long you had meant to stay apart or not spending at all.\nB) [substeps] For example, if you are married with children, you might say that you wanted adultery because your spouse had stopped living in the home and no children were born. You could claim that you wanted adultery because you're the father of a child and did not expect your children to be born on time.\nC) Nevertheless, some states allow people to file for divorce immediately if they can prove adultery. If they claim irreconcilable differences, then they may have to wait a period of time (such as six months).\nD) This is why, if not proven, \" nothing \" such as adultery isn't considered a fault. As such, you must consider whether you want to have your divorce made invalid, or how often you intend to continue the marriage to win.\n",
