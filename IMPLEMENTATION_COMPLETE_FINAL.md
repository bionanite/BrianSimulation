## Key Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each milestone is a separate, self-contained module
- **Integration Points**: Clear integration with existing Phase 1-5 systems
- **Backward Compatibility**: All modules maintain compatibility with `final_enhanced_brain.py`

### Features
- **Statistics Tracking**: All systems include performance metrics
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout
- **Type Hints**: Comprehensive type annotations
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all classes and methods

### Integration Strategy
- **Modular Integration**: New capabilities added as optional modules
- **Deep Integration**: Key systems integrated deeply where beneficial
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features can be added incrementally

## Verification

All files verified:
- ✅ Phase 6: 3 files
- ✅ Phase 7: 3 files
- ✅ Phase 8: 3 files
- ✅ Phase 9: 3 files
- ✅ Phase 10: 3 files
- ✅ Phase 11: 3 files
- ✅ Phase 12: 3 files
- ✅ Phase 13: 3 files

**Total: 24 modules across 8 phases**

## Next Steps
